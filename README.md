# Traffic_Management_Project
Traffic management system using opencv

This Project is Made to eliminate the congestion at the traffic junction.It mainly uses the concept of Machine learning,more specific -opencv.Using this project we can 
train the flow of traffic light based on the vehicle weightage at each lane of the junction.


STEPS TO RUN:
1.Pull this project to your local computer.
2.Open the project in an IDE.
3.Create a virtual environment.
4.Install all the prerequisite modules(requirements.txt)
5.Add a dnn model.
6.Run the main.py file.

note:-You can change the timing of traffc light flow based on the calculated data of how much a vehicle take to cross the junction.
